        <h2>The Eminence in Shadow</h2>
        <p>Publicado el <time datetime="2024-12-30">30 de diciembre de 2024</time>.</p> <br>>
        <p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eminence_in_Shadow" target="_blank"><i>The Eminence in
              Shadow</i> (Kage no Jitsuryokusha ni Naritakute!)</a> is a typical isekai genre, as you probably know,
          with all the clichés you've come to expect, but with one small twist: the protagonist wants to be an eminence
          in the shadows.</p>
        <p>At first, you might think, ("Well, this is pretty cool, but it would be even better if his circle of friends
          knew instead of treating him like an idiot"), but after a while, you get used to others thinking he's dumb.
          The girls, however, find his stupidity "charming".</p>
        <p>For example, when he is fighting a girl, to appear more stupid, he lets himself get hit and uses bags of
          blood to pretend he's injured. But he is clueless and doesn't realize that normal people can't be used as
          punching bags and then just walk away. The girl, on the other hand, is like ("Even though I'm practically
          torturing him, he doesn't give up.")</p>
        <p>One sad thing about it, and I'm warning you in case you don't like it either, is that he doesn't believe in
          what he does; it's all just a game to him. For instance, when he disguises himself as a boy from his school
          whose head was blown off, knowing that the attack on the school was real made it 300% more incredible.</p>
        <p>So far, they've only released six volumes, and if I'm not mistaken, the last one involved him dressing up as
          a clown and traumatizing a girl to the point where she starts fighting against society's evils. I know that my
          explanation of the 6th volume might be hard to understand. But that's partly my point—to pique your curiosity
          so you'll go read it yourself.</p>

            <p>Look, I know it's a web novel and not a light novel, but don't worry! What I say there is 95% applicable
              to the light novel version of the story. Plus, since I really like it, I've got plenty of articles for you
