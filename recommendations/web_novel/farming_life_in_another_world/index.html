        <h2>Farming Life in Another World</h2>
        <p class="publication-date">December 27, 2024</p> <br>
        <p><i>Farming Life in Another World</i> (Isekai Nonbiri Nouka) is the only web novel I’ve read, and I absolutely
          loved it! It’s a wonder, a delight in every sense. Even with some limitations, I read it in Spanish, which is
          a bit sad because a lot is lost in translation from Japanese to English and then to Spanish. Nonetheless, it
          was a fascinating experience. I still enjoyed it immensely. Every chapter kept me hooked and craving more.
          I've only had time to read the first 413 chapters, but I've already downloaded four PDFs with the web novel
          translated into Spanish with chapters from 414 to 741. I’m very excited to continue. Additionally, I have four
          more PDFs pre-downloaded with chapters from 742 to 881. So, my adventure is far from over. The following might
          contain spoilers from the first 80 chapters!</p> <br>
        <p>The story is about a boy who is very sick and dies. However, his fate changes radically when God gives him a
          second chance in another world, along with a replica of a divine dance, though the protagonist doesn’t know
          it. Equipped with extraordinary abilities, the protagonist is overpowered and has incredible skills. For
          example, he:</p> <br>
        <ul class="ul-list">
          <li>
            <p>Can kill "rabbits," those rabbits that require several soldiers from the demon kingdom to defeat just
              one.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Can kill boars, those boars he kills with a single blow to the head. Hahaha, if a cute rabbit from that
              forest is crazy, imagine a boar!</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Encountered two infernal wolves (huge wolves with knife-like horns on their heads) and thought they were
              hungry puppies, so he gave them boar meat. The wolves were surprised, thinking ("How scary, this guy treats
              us like normal dogs and gives us boar meat from this forest as if it were nothing.") Those two wolves,
              named Kuro and Yuki, had kids, and those kids had kids, and the protagonist ended up with a pack of
              infernal wolves from the great forest of death, enough to conquer a country.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Has an army of demon spiders.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>His first wife is Ruu Rurushi, the Vampire Princess.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>His second wife is Tier, the Angel of Annihilation.</p>
          </li>
        </ul> <br>
        <p>I won’t give more examples of how incredible it is because I’d end up telling the whole novel. Unfortunately,
          I haven't read the novel in a long time, so some details escape me. Therefore, I don't remember the details
          very well, but if I’m very lost, I just need to reread five or six chapters to refresh my memory. Basically,
          it’s incredible.</p>

        <h2>¿El pueblo del gran arbol es Comunista?</h2>
        <p class="publication-date">2 de enero del 2025</p> <br>
        <p>Ustendes tambien no les pasa como a mi que mientras más pasan los capitulos la casita del protagonista pasa a ser un pueblo que vive en sosiendad comunitaria [Similar a como vivian los humanos en la prehistoria] a ser un pueblo y luego a ser practicamente un pais [Por donde voy todavia no se idependentizan del reino del rey demonio si es que en algun momento lo hace]</p>
